# This is the official code for the metric framework PROBE

PROBE folder consists of 7 models and a implementation file for PROBE

## 7 models
The original source code for each model is as follows

- [ComplEx and RotatE](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding)
- [TuckEr](https://github.com/ibalazevic/TuckER)
- [HousE](https://github.com/rui9812/HousE)
- [pLogicNet](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/pLogicNet)
- [RNNLogic](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/RNNLogic)
- CompGCN : The [original code](https://github.com/malllabiisc/CompGCN) wasn't runable in our enviornment. Thus we implement our own CompGCN by using [pykeen](https://github.com/pykeen/pykeen).
